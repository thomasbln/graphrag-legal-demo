# Inspiration: Kirk Marple's "The Context Layer"

## Source

**Article:** "The Context Layer: Unlocking AI's Trillion-Dollar Potential"  
**Author:** Kirk Marple (CEO, Graphlit)  
**Published:** December 2024

## Key Thesis

The next AI wave is the **Context Layer** - structured knowledge graphs that make data queryable, not just searchable.

**Quote:**

> "RAG conquered 2024, but it's fundamentally limited. The next wave is structured knowledge - graphs that understand relationships, not just similarity."

## How This Inspired Our Demo

### 1. Legal = Perfect Use Case

- Contracts are structured (parties, clauses, dates)
- Relationships matter (contract → clauses → types)
- Traditional RAG fails at contract queries
- **Proves Kirk's thesis with real data**

### 2. The 5 Killer Queries

Each demonstrates a RAG limitation Kirk mentioned:

- ❌ Negative search (absence)
- ❌ Multi-criteria (AND logic)
- ❌ Aggregation (counting)
- ❌ Traversal (relationships)
- ❌ Boolean logic (complex queries)

### 3. Architecture Alignment

```
Our Demo               Kirk's Context Layer
---------              --------------------
Natural Language   →   User Interface
Claude API         →   LLM Layer
Cypher Generation  →   Query Translation
Neo4j              →   Knowledge Graph
Analysis           →   Insight Generation
```

**We're implementing his framework!**

## Article Strategy

### Reference in Introduction

```markdown
As Kirk Marple (CEO, Graphlit) wrote: "RAG conquered 2024,
but the next wave is the Context Layer - structured knowledge
that makes data queryable, not just searchable."

This demo proves his thesis with legal contracts.
```

### Reference in Conclusion

```markdown
Kirk Marple predicted the Context Layer's trillion-dollar
potential. Legal contracts are just one domain. The pattern
applies everywhere structure matters.
```
